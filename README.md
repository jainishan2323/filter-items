# filter-items

Steps to run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. make sure you have chrome browser in machine

known issues:
1. While searching for a filter it's context is lost sometimes although the filter remains on the list of data (can be mitigated if there is a single container for filters didnt really had much time to work on it).

2. Checkbox styiling (I applied the desired style but on select the attached event was lost, again didnt really had much time to investigate).
